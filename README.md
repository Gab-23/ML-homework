# Machine Learning Homework

Here you can find a small Machine Learning project for the study of a Codon Usage Bias dataset. The project is organized in different steps: Dataprocessing, Exploratory analysis, Clustering, Regression and Classification.

Please note that, due to the Notebook size, some chunks do not display the graphical output. I decided to show the most interesting plots. Running all chunks is advised.

Please note also that not all of the code is mine! Some functions have been provided by the Teaching Assistants during the lessons.
